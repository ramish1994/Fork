# Fork
 
1) Write a program to login to TheFork and validate your personal information. Your script should do this the same way a typical human user would do it, using a web browser, but entirely automated and independently:
* Open up the TheFork home screen (on the web -, for native app you can get it from the App Store or Play Store).
* Login to the site. You will need to have an account created for this to have appropriate credentials.
* Open My Personal Information section and assert that the personal information matches with your account information.
Upload the script you have created to GitHub/Gitlab and send us the link back with instructions including the command to run it.
Requirements:
Use of Selenium or Appium to drive the app and using a test framework is fine (Mocha, JUnit, TestNG, Pytest, etc.).
Do not use any other libraries or frameworks, do not use Cucumber or any other other BDD framework.
The language you use does not matter but use preferably use one of these: Node.js/JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, Java, C# (for C#, keep in mind we use Macs at TheFork so we will not be able to use Visual Studio for Windows to review your solution)
Think about how you layout and structure your code.

2) Pok√©API - Using the following URL https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=30,  each one has a URL that has the data of each pokemon. Retrieve that url and access it, save in a list only the pokemon that are normal type or that one of their types is normal type.
You can take a look at the API documentation (https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) in case you have any questions.
